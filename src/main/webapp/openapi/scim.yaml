  description: |-
    These Open API specifications are a non-normitive example implementation of both the adopted and draft SCIM related RFCs. Service providers are encoraged to copy them as a starting point for defining their own service.

    For full details view the RFCs of the [IETF SCIM working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scim/documents/)



    ## Base URI
    Implementers are free to choose any base URI that they desire. The ones provided here are samples based on the examples in the RFCs. 

    The spec suggests using the base URI or a header to identify tenents in a multi tenant service.

    Per [rfc7644#section-3.13](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.13) a version indicator may optionally be added to the **end** of the base URI. Requests to a base URI without a version indicator should be treated the same as requests to the most recent version.

    ## Security
    Implementers are free to choose any security scheme they want. OAuth2 access tokens in the Authorization header are the most common. There are some other suggested ones in [rfc7644#section-2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-2)

    In some SCIM deployments, it MAY be acceptable to permit
    unauthenticated (anonymous) requests -- for example, a user
    self-registration request.

    ## Message Bodies
    All request and response bodies should be JSON with a `schema` attribute at the root

    # Key Terms

    Service Provider - The application that implements some or all of these API endpoints

    Client - The application that calls these API endpoints

    Message - The body of a request or response

    Resource - A singular record of data made up of the common attributes, its base schema and any extension schemas. Service providers may define their own additional resource types.

    Schema - A set of attributes (fields) that a resource or message can contain.

    # Processing Rules

    See [rfc7644#section-3.3 to 3.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.3) for full details.

    It is expected that service providers will not support all of the attributes defined by the specifications. As such both service provider and clients should ignore any unknown attributes.

    Service providers shall ignore any attributes marked as read-only when sent in a request.

    Service providers may apply transformations to the data they recieve in requests. They should respond with the transformed version of the resource.

    Attributes whose mutability is "readWrite" (see Section 2.2 of
    [RFC7643]) and that are omitted from the request body MAY be
    assumed to be not asserted by the client.  The service provider
    MAY assign a default value to non-asserted attributes in the final
    resource representation.

    Service providers MAY take into account whether or not a client
    has access to all of the resource's attributes when deciding
    whether or not non-asserted attributes should be defaulted.

    Clients that intend to override existing or server-defaulted
    values for attributes MAY specify `null` for a single-valued
    attribute or an empty array `[]` for a multi-valued attribute to
    clear all values.

    If the service provider determines that the creation of the requested resource conflicts with existing resources (e.g., a "User" resource with a duplicate "userName"), the service provider MUST return HTTP status code 409 (Conflict) with a "scimType" error code of "uniqueness", as per Section 3.12.

    Before comparing or evaluating the uniqueness of a
     "userName" or "password" attribute, service providers MUST use the
     preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings
     (PRECIS) preparation and comparison rules described in Sections 3 and
     4, respectively, of [RFC7613], which is based on the PRECIS framework
     specification [RFC7564].

      description: 'Filtering is an OPTIONAL parameter for SCIM service providers.    Clients MAY discover service provider filter capabilities by looking    at the "filter" attribute of the "ServiceProviderConfig" endpoint    (see Section 4).  Clients MAY request a subset of resources by    specifying the "filter" query parameter containing a filter    expression.  When specified, only those resources matching the filter    expression SHALL be returned.  The expression language that is used    with the filter parameter supports references to attributes and    literals.     Attribute names and attribute operators used in filters are case    insensitive.  For example, the following two expressions will    evaluate to the same logical value:     filter=userName Eq "john"     filter=Username eq "john"     The filter parameter MUST contain at least one valid expression (see    Table 3).  Each expression MUST contain an attribute name followed by    an attribute operator and optional value.  Multiple expressions MAY    be combined using logical operators (see Table 4).

               definition (see Section 8.7 of [RFC7643])
          items:
            type: string
        id:
          type: string
          description: |-
            A unique identifier for a SCIM resource as defined by the service
             provider.  Each representation of the resource MUST include a
             non-empty "id" value.  This identifier MUST be unique across the
             SCIM service provider's entire set of resources.  It MUST be a
             stable, non-reassignable identifier that does not change when the
             same resource is returned in subsequent requests.  The value of
             the "id" attribute is always issued by the service provider and
             MUST NOT be specified by the client.  The string "bulkId" is a
             reserved keyword and MUST NOT be used within any unique identifier
             value.  The attribute characteristics are "caseExact" as "true", a
             mutability of "readOnly", and a "returned" characteristic of
             "always".  See Section 9 for additional considerations regarding
             privacy.
          readOnly: true
        externalId:
          type: string
          description: |-
            A String that is an identifier for the resource as defined by the
            provisioning client.  The "externalId" may simplify identification
            of a resource between the provisioning client and the service
            provider by allowing the client to use a filter to locate the
            resource with an identifier from the provisioning domain,
            obviating the need to store a local mapping between the
            provisioning domain's identifier of the resource and the
            identifier used by the service provider.  Each resource MAY
            include a non-empty "externalId" value.  The value of the
            "externalId" attribute is always issued by the provisioning client
            and MUST NOT be specified by the service provider.  The service
            provider MUST always interpret the externalId as scoped to the
            provisioning domain.  While the server does not enforce
            uniqueness, it is assumed that the value's uniqueness is
            controlled by the client setting the value.  See Section 9 for
            additional considerations regarding privacy.  This attribute has
            "caseExact" as "true" and a mutability of "readWrite".  This
            attribute is OPTIONAL.
        meta:
          type: object
          description: |-
            A complex attribute containing resource metadata.  All "meta"
            sub-attributes are assigned by the service provider (have a
            "mutability" of "readOnly"), and all of these sub-attributes have
            a "returned" characteristic of "default".  This attribute SHALL be
            ignored when provided by clients.  "meta" contains the following
            sub-attributes:
          properties:
            resourceType:
              type: string
              description: |-
                The name of the resource type of the resource.  This attribute has a mutability of "readOnly" and "caseExact" as "true".

                When adding a resource to a specific endpoint, the meta attribute
                   "resourceType" SHALL be set by the HTTP service provider to the
                   corresponding resource type for the endpoint.  For example, a POST to
                   the endpoint "/Users" will set "resourceType" to "User", and
                   "/Groups" will set "resourceType" to "Group".

                The most recent DateTime that the details of this
                resource were updated at the service provider.  If this
                resource has never been modified since its initial creation,

                The URI of the resource being returned.  This value MUST
                be the same as the "Content-Location" HTTP response header (see

                must be the same as the entity-tag (ETag) HTTP response header
                (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3 of [RFC7232]).  This attribute has
                "caseExact" as "true".  Service provider support for this
                attribute is optional and subject to the service provider's
                support for versioning (see Section 3.14 of [RFC7644]).  If a
                service provider provides "version" (entity-tag) for a
                representation and the generation of that entity-tag does not
                satisfy all of the characteristics of a strong validator (see
                Section 2.1 of [RFC7232]), then the origin server MUST mark the
                "version" (entity-tag) as weak by prefixing its opaque value
                with "W/" (case sensitive).

          description: |-
            A Boolean value indicating the 'primary' or preferred attribute
            value for this attribute, e.g., the preferred mailing address or
            the primary email address.  The primary attribute value "true"

            The reference URI of a target resource, if the attribute is a
            reference.  URIs are canonicalized per Section 6.2 of [RFC3986].
            While the representation of a resource may vary in different SCIM
            protocol API versions (see Section 3.13 of [RFC7644]), URIs for
            SCIM resources with an API version SHALL be considered comparable
            to URIs without a version or with a different version.  For
            example, "https://example.com/Users/12345" is equivalent to

          description: |-
            A service provider's unique identifier for the user, typically
            used by the user to directly authenticate to the service provider.
            Often displayed to the user as their unique identifier within the
            system (as opposed to "id" or "externalId", which are generally
            opaque and not user-friendly identifiers).  Each User MUST include
            a non-empty userName value.  This identifier MUST be unique across
            the service provider's entire set of Users.  This attribute is
            REQUIRED and is case insensitive.
        name:

            sub-attribute, or they MAY return just the individual component
            attributes using the other sub-attributes, or they MAY return
            both.  If both variants are returned, they SHOULD be describing

            SHOULD be the full name of the User being described, if known
            (e.g., "Babs Jensen" or "Ms. Barbara J Jensen, III") but MAY be a
            username or handle, if that is all that is available (e.g.,
            "bjensen").  The value provided SHOULD be the primary textual
            label by which this User is normally displayed by the service
            provider when presenting it to end-users.
        nickName:
          type: string

            The casual way to address the user in real life, e.g., "Bob" or
            "Bobby" instead of "Robert".  This attribute SHOULD NOT be used to
            represent a User's username (e.g., bjensen or mpepperidge).
        profileUrl:
          type: string
          format: uri
          description: |-
            A URI that is a uniform resource locator (as defined in
            Section 1.1.3 of [RFC3986]) and that points to a location
            representing the user's online profile (e.g., a web page).  URIs

            "Intern", "Temp", "External", and "Unknown", but any value may be
            used.
        preferredLanguage:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Indicates the user's preferred written or spoken languages and is
            generally used for selecting a localized user interface.  The
            value indicates the set of natural languages that are preferred.
            The format of the value is the same as the HTTP Accept-Language
            header field (not including "Accept-Language:") and is specified
            in Section 5.3.5 of [RFC7231].  The intent of this value is to
            enable cloud applications to perform matching of language tags
            [RFC4647] to the user's language preferences, regardless of what
            may be indicated by a user agent (which might be shared), or in an interaction that does not involve a user (such as in a delegated
            OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] style interaction) where normal HTTP
            Accept-Language header negotiation cannot take place.
        locale:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Used to indicate the User's default location for purposes of
            localizing such items as currency, date time format, or numerical
            representations.  A valid value is a language tag as defined in
            [RFC5646].  Computer languages are explicitly excluded.

            A language tag is a sequence of one or more case-insensitive
            sub-tags, each separated by a hyphen character ("-", %x2D).  For
            backward compatibility, servers MAY accept tags separated by an
            underscore character ("_", %x5F).  In most cases, a language tag
            consists of a primary language sub-tag that identifies a broad
            family of related languages (e.g., "en" = English) and that is
            optionally followed by a series of sub-tags that refine or narrow
            that language's range (e.g., "en-CA" = the variety of English as
            communicated in Canada).  Whitespace is not allowed within a 
            language tag.  

            Example tags include: fr, en-US, es-419, az-Arab, x-pig-latin, man-Nkoo-GN

            See [RFC5646] for further information.
        timezone:

            The User's time zone, in IANA Time Zone database format [RFC6557],
                  also known as the "Olson" time zone database format [Olson-TZ]
                  (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles").
        active:
          type: boolean
          description: |-
            A Boolean value indicating the user's administrative status.  The
            definitive meaning of this attribute is determined by the service
            provider.  As a typical example, a value of true implies that the
            user is able to log in, while a value of false implies that the
            user's account has been suspended.
        password:
          type: string
          description: |
            This attribute is intended to be used as a means to set, replace,
            or compare (i.e., filter for equality) a password.  The cleartext
            value or the hashed value of a password SHALL NOT be returnable by
            a service provider.  If a service provider holds the value
            locally, the value SHOULD be hashed.  When a password is set or
            changed by the client, the cleartext password SHOULD be processed
            by the service provider as follows:

            *  Prepare the cleartext value for international language
                comparison.  See Section 7.8 of [RFC7644].

            *  Validate the value against server password policy.  Note: The
                definition and enforcement of password policy are beyond the
                scope of this document.

            *  Ensure that the value is encrypted (e.g., hashed).  See
                Section 9.2 for acceptable hashing and encryption handling when
                storing or persisting for provisioning workflow reasons.

            A service provider that immediately passes the cleartext value on
            to another system or programming interface MUST pass the value
            directly over a secured connection (e.g., Transport Layer Security
            (TLS)).  If the value needs to be temporarily persisted for a
            period of time (e.g., because of a workflow) before provisioning,
            then the value MUST be protected by some method, such as
            encryption.

            Testing for an equality match MAY be supported if there is an
            existing stored hashed value.  When testing for equality, the
            service provider:

            *  Prepares the filter value for international language
                comparison.  See Section 7.8 of [RFC7644].

            *  Generates the salted hash of the filter value and tests for a
                match with the locally held value.

            The mutability of the password attribute is "writeOnly",
            indicating that the value MUST NOT be returned by a service
            provider in any form (the attribute characteristic "returned" is
            "never").
          writeOnly: true
        emails:
          type: array
          description: |-
            Email addresses for the User.  The value SHOULD be specified
            according to [RFC5321].  Service providers SHOULD canonicalize the
            value according to [RFC5321], e.g., "bjensen@example.com" instead
            of "bjensen@EXAMPLE.COM".  The "display" sub-attribute MAY be used
            to return the canonicalized representation of the email value.
            The "type" sub-attribute is used to provide a classification
            meaningful to the (human) user.  The user interface should
            encourage the use of basic values of "work", "home", and "other"
            and MAY allow additional type values to be used at the discretion
            of SCIM clients.

            'tel:+1-201-555-0123'.  Service providers SHOULD canonicalize the
            value according to [RFC3966] format, when appropriate.  The
            "display" sub-attribute MAY be used to return the canonicalized
            representation of the phone number value.  The sub-attribute
            "type" often has typical values of "work", "home", "mobile",
            "fax", "pager", and "other" and MAY allow more types to be defined
            by the SCIM clients.

            Section 1.1.3 of [RFC3986]) that points to a resource location

            a GIF, JPEG, or PNG image file) rather than a web page containing
            an image.  Service providers MAY return the same image in
            different sizes, although it is recognized that no standard for
            describing images of various sizes currently exists.  Note that
            this attribute SHOULD NOT be used to send down arbitrary photos

        groups:
          type: array
          description: |-
            A list of groups to which the user belongs, either through direct
            membership, through nested groups, or dynamically calculated.  The
            values are meant to enable expression of common group-based or
            role-based access control models, although no explicit
            authorization model is defined.  It is intended that the semantics
            of group membership and any behavior or authorization granted as a
            result of membership are defined by the service provider.  The
            canonical types "direct" and "indirect" are defined to describe
            how the group membership was derived.  Direct group membership
            indicates that the user is directly associated with the group and
            SHOULD indicate that clients may modify membership through the
            "Group" resource.  Indirect membership indicates that user
            membership is transitive or dynamic and implies that clients
            cannot modify indirect group membership through the "Group"
            resource but MAY modify direct group membership through the
            "Group" resource, which may influence indirect memberships.  If
            the SCIM service provider exposes a "Group" resource, the "value"
            sub-attribute MUST be the "id", and the "$ref" sub-attribute must
            be the URI of the corresponding "Group" resources to which the
            user belongs.  Since this attribute has a mutability of
            "readOnly", group membership changes MUST be applied via the
            "Group" Resource (Section 4.2).  This attribute has a mutability
            of "readOnly".

            object, or service.  No vocabulary or syntax is specified; service
            providers and clients are expected to encode sufficient
            information in the value so as to accurately and without ambiguity
            determine what the user has access to.  This value has no
            canonical types, although a type may be useful as a means to scope
            entitlements.

        A query against a server root indicates that all resources within the
         server SHALL be included, subject to filtering.  A filter expression
         using "meta.resourceType" MAY be used to restrict results to one or
         more specific resource types (to exclude others).  For example:

         `filter=(meta.resourceType eq User) or (meta.resourceType eq Group)`

         If a SCIM service provider determines that too many results would be
         returned (e.g., because a client queried a resource type endpoint or
         the server base URI), the server SHALL reject the request by
         returning an HTTP response with HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request)
         and JSON attribute "scimType" set to "tooMany" (see Table 9).

         When processing query operations using endpoints that include more
         than one SCIM resource type (e.g., a query from the server root
         endpoint), filters MUST be processed as outlined in Section 3.4.2.2.
         For filtered attributes that are not part of a particular resource
         type, the service provider SHALL treat the attribute as if there is
         no attribute value.  For example, a presence or equality filter for
         an undefined attribute evaluates to false.
